What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

git merge is combining changes from one branch into another branch

git rebase is moving the start of the current branch to a later commit after you branch out
(resetting the base of our branch to match another branch)

What is a remote repository? 

It is a central online repository that is seen by the rest of your team. 
You can push and pull (fetch + merge) from your local repository 
to keep your local updated to the remote current version used by the team.
